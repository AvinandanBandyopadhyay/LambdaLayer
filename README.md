# LambdaLayer

A small demonstration of lambda layers in NodeJS using Axios library has been done here.

Two modules namely AxiosLayer and RestClient are commited.

AxiosLayer as the name suggested is the layer and RestClient is the calling lambda.

The code for RestClient is deployed using aws serverless technique.
